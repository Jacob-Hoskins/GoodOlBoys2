                  <h3>Want a new look and feel to your rooms?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Painting a room is a great way to give your house that brand
                    new feel and make you feel the way you did when you first
                    bought it. It can also increase your houses value by an
                    average of $4,000.

                  <h3>Protecting your house from nature</h3>
                  <p>
                    Paint can give your home a added layer of protection from
                    natural elements and keep your home safe from weather
                    damage, insects, and dust. And if your house has a wood
                    exterior it can help keep your wood from rotting!
